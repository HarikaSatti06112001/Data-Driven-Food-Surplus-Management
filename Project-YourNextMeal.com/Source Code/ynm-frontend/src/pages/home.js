            <p>At present, the world is facing a hunger crisis of unprecedented proportions. Pre-pandemic, food insecurity affected 135 million people in 53 nations; today, it affects 345 million people in 82 countries (Source: World Food Programme). Climate change and the current conflict in Ukraine are all contributing to the crisis's escalation by raising the price of food, fuel, and fertilizer. In addition, the bulk of extra food is wasted, which is sent directly to landfills and incinerators. A staggering 35% of the 229 million tons of food that were available in 2019 in the U.S. alone went unsold or uneaten. As technology students, our goal is to help people fulfill their urgent food needs by establishing an ecosystem of food donors and recipients so that businesses and  individuals who have extra food can donate it to those in need, hence decreasing food waste and lessening the number of people sleeping hungry.</p>
            <p>Currently, there appears to be a lack of a network of organizations and volunteers engaged in this activity, and neither donors nor recipients seem particularly motivated to do so. Food wastage as a result of ineffective or delayed distribution is a serious concern as well. “YourNextMeal” is a platform that will bridge the gap between food donors (restaurants and individuals) and those in need of food via the charity organizations advancing this worthwhile cause. In order for the excess food to reach those in need, the donors can use the network of drivers (non-profit organizations) by either giving it to volunteers or by dropping it off in person at food collection sites. The communication between donors and receivers would be facilitated by establishing a system of requests and acknowledgements on “YourNextMeal”. Individuals who can drive and are keen to assist with distribution operations can also join as volunteers and help with transportation concerns. By communicating with the distributor through photographs, the donors can further confirm that their food has reached the appropriate people.</p>
            <p>We strongly believe this platform can be enhanced further and be monetized by charging restaurants and grocery chains with a monthly fee. Subscribers of this service will have access to food wastage insights, itemized tax deductions and be able to promote their brand to society.</p>
